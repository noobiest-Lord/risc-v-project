In design:
    Use reg for values stored in sequential logic (flip-flops, registers)
    Use wire for combinational logic
In testbench:
    Use reg for inputs (because you're driving them)
    Use wire for outputs (because you're observing them)

to run:
    run iverilog -o (file name u want.vvp) testbench.v design.v
    vvp file name u want.vvp
    run surfer

for multiple bits: ([max bit: min bit])

if you add always to a testbench, it will keep running. to stop it, add $finish to your algorithm

initital block only works once!, while always and assign always keep running

if output variable is inside an always or initial block, it would be a output reg

to concatonate = {a, b}, {4{a}}

for assign use =
for always and include use either <= or = depending

in testbench, always use = for initial begin
